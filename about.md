S U M M A R Y
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Freelance SRE & Backend Engineer with a foundation in full-stack development and 
a strong focus on backend programming, infrastructure as code, automation, and 
system reliability. I specialize in developing/supporting complex systems 
end-to-end — combining backend engineering with the operational rigor needed to 
ensure stability, observability, and long-term maintainability.

Recently, I've been deepening my work in the AI/LLM space — developing tools that 
apply backend and devops/SRE principles to modern AI workflows. My recent 
projects integrate structured LLM queries, real-time Slack interactions, and 
local classification models to enhance support workflows and surface meaningful 
insights. I approach AI development not as experimentation, but as systems work 
as it’s not just about building what works “for now” but will still be working 
down the road.
